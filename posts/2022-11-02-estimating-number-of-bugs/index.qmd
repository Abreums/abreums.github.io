Consider the following situation:

For a software version 3 different testers found each one a different number of bugs in the system, but a total of 10 different bugs.

Tester 1 found bugs number 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

Tester 2 found bugs number 3, 5, 6, and 7 (two of the same bugs of Tester1, plus two other bugs not found by Tester 1).

Tester 3 found bugs 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, and 10.

Consider each bug is equally difficult/easy to be found.

The 3 testers worked in an independent way. And they are equally efficient.

How many bugs could we estimate exist in this version of the system?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To solve this question let's use the Mark and Capture strategy for estimation of populations as described by [@WikipediaUnknownMark:8f76].

```{r}
library(Rcapture)

bugs <- matrix(c(1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,
                 0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,
                 1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1), 
               ncol = 3)

closedp(bugs)

```

We can estimate a number of 13 + 3 \* stderr bugs, which is approximately 22 bugs.
